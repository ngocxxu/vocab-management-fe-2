```

### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by searching the entire project for `FIXME:` to make quick customizations. Here are some of the most important files to customize:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/BaseTemplate.tsx`: default theme
- `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration
- `.env`: default environment variables

You have full access to the source code for further customization. The provided code is just an example to help you start your project. The sky's the limit 🚀.

### Commit Message Format

The project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification, meaning all commit messages must be formatted accordingly. To help you write commit messages, the project provides an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
pnpm run commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is the ability to automatically generate GitHub releases. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Deploy to production

Then, you can generate a production build with:

```shell
$ pnpm run build
```

[![Run the command in Warp](public/assets/images/warp-banner.png)](https://go.warp.dev/nextjs-bp)

It generates an optimized production build of the boilerplate. To test the generated build, run:

```shell
$ pnpm run start
```

This command starts a local server using the production build. You can now open http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser to see the result.

### Deploy to Sevalla

You can deploy a Next.js application along with its database on a single platform. First, create an account on [Sevalla](https://sevalla.com).

After registration, you will be redirected to the dashboard. From there, click `Application > Create an App`. After connecting your GitHub account, select the repository you want to deploy. Keep the default settings for the remaining options, then click `Create`.

Finally, initiate a new deployment by clicking `Overview > Latest deployments > Deploy now`. If everything is set up correctly, your application will be deployed successfully.

### Error Monitoring

The project uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/for/nextjs/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=general-fy25q1-nextjs&utm_content=github-banner-nextjsboilerplate-logo) to monitor errors. In the development environment, no additional setup is needed: SaaS Boilerplate is pre-configured to use Sentry and Spotlight (Sentry for Development). All errors will automatically be sent to your local Spotlight instance, allowing you to experience Sentry locally.

For production environment, you'll need to create a Sentry account and a new project. Then, in `.env.production`, you need to update the following environment variables:

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=
SENTRY_ORGANIZATION=
SENTRY_PROJECT=
```

You also need to create a environment variable `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in your hosting provider's dashboard.

### Code coverage

Next.js Boilerplate relies on [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/codecov-free-trial/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=general-fy25q1-nextjs&utm_content=github-banner-nextjsboilerplate-logo) for code coverage reporting solution. To enable Codecov, create a Codecov account and connect it to your GitHub account. Your repositories should appear on your Codecov dashboard. Select the desired repository and copy the token. In GitHub Actions, define the `CODECOV_TOKEN` environment variable and paste the token.

Make sure to create `CODECOV_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions secret, do not paste it directly into your source code.

### Logging

The project uses LogTape for logging. In the development environment, logs are displayed in the console by default.

For production, the project is already integrated with [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=next-js-boilerplate) to manage and query your logs using SQL. To use Better Stack, you need to create a [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=next-js-boilerplate) account and create a new source: go to your Better Stack Logs Dashboard > Sources > Connect source. Then, you need to give a name to your source and select Node.js as the platform.

After creating the source, you will be able to view and copy your source token. In your environment variables, paste the token into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_STACK_SOURCE_TOKEN` variable. You'll also need to define the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_STACK_INGESTING_HOST` variable, which can be found in the same place as the source token.

Now, all logs will automatically be sent to and ingested by Better Stack.

### Arcjet security and bot protection

The project uses [Arcjet](https://launch.arcjet.com/Q6eLbRE), a security as code product that includes several features that can be used individually or combined to provide defense in depth for your site.

To set up Arcjet, [create a free account](https://launch.arcjet.com/Q6eLbRE) and get your API key. Then add it to the `ARCJET_KEY` environment variable.

Arcjet is configured with two main features: bot detection and the Arcjet Shield WAF:

- [Bot detection](https://docs.arcjet.com/bot-protection/concepts) is configured to allow search engines, preview link generators e.g. Slack and Twitter previews, and to allow common uptime monitoring services. All other bots, such as scrapers and AI crawlers, will be blocked. You can [configure additional bot types](https://docs.arcjet.com/bot-protection/identifying-bots) to allow or block.
- [Arcjet Shield WAF](https://docs.arcjet.com/shield/concepts) will detect and block common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

Arcjet is configured with a central client at `src/libs/Arcjet.ts` that includes the Shield WAF rules. Additional rules are applied when Arcjet is called in `middleware.ts`.

### Useful commands

### Code Quality and Validation

The project includes several commands to ensure code quality and consistency. You can run:

- `pnpm run lint` to check for linting errors
- `pnpm run lint:fix` to automatically fix fixable issues from the linter
- `pnpm run check:types` to verify type safety across the entire project
- `pnpm run check:deps` help identify unused dependencies and files

#### Bundle Analyzer

Next.js Boilerplate includes a built-in bundle analyzer. It can be used to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles. To begin, run the following command:

```shell
pnpm run build-stats
```

By running the command, it'll automatically open a new browser window with the results.

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode user, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed in your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and display errors. The same applies to testing: you can install the VSCode Vitest extension to automatically run your tests, and it also shows the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide-type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
